# Household management

## Feature description 

* The household feature allows users to create or share a household (a group of connected users).

* Users can add other users to their houshold - this might be a permission that only the creator has.

* Users in a household can see each others entities (shopping lists, events, etc…). This might be controlled with a private/share toggle.

* Users can edit and add to other users entities but only the creator of an entity can delete it.

* The app can be used without creating a household - in which case the username is displayed in the Home page.

* If a household has been created then the household name is displayed in the Home page
