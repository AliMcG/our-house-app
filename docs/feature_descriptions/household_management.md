# Household management

## Feature description 

* The household feature allows users to create or share a household (a group of connected users).

* Users can add other users to their houshold - this might be a permission that only the creator has.

* Users in a household can see each others entities (shopping lists, events, etcâ€¦). This might be controlled with a private/share toggle.

* Users can edit and add to other users entities but only the creator of an entity can delete it.
